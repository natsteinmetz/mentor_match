== Mentor-Mentee Matchmaking app

This is a simple mentor mentee matchmaking app. It uses a has_many through association, with the join model Mentorship. 

Also, it uses a main controller to generate a main view that contains elements from both main models. Strings that are used in select forms for the view are initialized within an initializer file (config/initializers/app_init.rb), and are accessible throughout the app.
